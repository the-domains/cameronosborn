## My theory

### Software

Mark Twain remarks that one of the fundamental rules of writing is the author must say what he means, not merely come close. I like to take the same tack when it comes to software development---the tools presented to us in the digital world are limited at this point by only our imaginations; we ought to expect that the software we use does what it needs to, not merely come close. My goal as a software developer is to build systems that present the user with a custom solution that fits their needs precisely.

### Web Design

The internet is a limitless tool that can be used to reach audiences, sell products, connect with customers, and contact supporters. As a web developer, I help you access and capitalize on this incredible infrastructure. Whether you have a business or a blog, your \[stuff\] is constantly changing. I'll build you a website that can keep up.

## What I Do

Speaking technically, I work in the following programming languages:

**Software**

* C\#
* C++
* VB.NET
* Visual Basic
* Visual Basic for Applications

**Web Design**

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery

**Web Frameworks**

* Squarespace
* Word Press
* Wix

## I also offer

**Training**

**Documentation**

**Site Maintenance**

**Social Media Development and Maintenance**

**Online Outreach**

**Integrated Digital Marketing**

I write stand-alone programs; add programmatic functionality to Microsoft Office programs such as Word, Excel(r), and Access(tm); design and hand-code websites from scratch; and develop and maintain websites using the common web-based frameworks---such as SquareSpace, Word Press, and others.

Speaking simply, I ensure that software I write and websites I develop meet the needs of my clients.
