            <description><![CDATA[<p>Mark Twain remarks that one of the fundamental rules of writing is the author must say what he means, not merely come close. I like to take the same tack when it comes to software developmentâ€”the tools presented to us in the digital world are limited at this point by only our imaginations; we ought to expect that the software we use does what it needs to, not merely come close. My goal as a software developer is to build systems that present the user with a custom solution that fits their needs precisely.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Story</h1><p>I've always had a knack for helping people with their technology.
